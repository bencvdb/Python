# objective: to create a program that utilizes a class to store and DNA base data from a file

# class: it will analyze the number of each of the following ATCG
#			it will also be able to record the number of times a certain sequence appears in a file


#the class that will have the method for reading a file (one line at a time)
class Sequence:
	
	#bases being counted
	g = 0
	a = 0
	t = 0
	c = 0

	# function that reads each character at a time and increments the appropriate base
